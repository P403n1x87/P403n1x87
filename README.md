### Synopsis

Gabriele has a curiosity that's hard to appease. Since a early age he's always
been intrigued by Science and Nature and wanted to know more about its
fundamental laws. Together with his taste for abstraction as a way to find order
and rigour in things, he embarked on an adventure to learn about Physics and
Mathematics. He likes Technology very much too, a trait you could have guessed
if you had the chance to see him crack open any gizmos he came across to see
what was inside and understand how they worked.


### Changelog

2016 - Upgrade to PhD Pure Mathematics

2011 - Upgrade to MSc Theoretical Physics

2009 - Upgrade to BSc Physics

1987 - Initial release


### Publications

A list of all my academic publications can be found on
[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/a/tornetta_g_1.html).

I also maintain [The Hub of Heliopolis](http://p403n1x87.github.io/), a blog
where I collect the notes of my experiments with technology.


### Main Projects

Currently, my main project is [Austin](https://github.com/P403n1x87/austin), a
frame stack sampler for CPython which can be used to build powerful statistical
profilers for Python applications that don't require instrumentation and have
minimal impact on the application runtime, making it ideal for profiling in
production.


### Growth

I always wanted to learn about Machine Learning and in 2018 I started exploring
its mathematical fundamentals. The result is a set of notes that collect
rigorous results in the field which I hope to get published soon.

My project [Marvin](https://github.com/P403n1x87/marvin) collects some code that
I wrote as part of my experiments and applications of ML techniques that I have
used to solve certain problems.
